GAME RULES

Prison Tetris is played on a grid called the Playfield. 

Tetrimino shapes drop one-by-one from the top of the Playfield to the bottom. With each level, the speed at which the Tetriminos drop increases. 

Before a Tetrimino reaches the bottom of the Playfield, you can move and rotate this shape to fit your desired position and avoid crushing the prisoner. 

Keep in mind that you are also in control of the prisoner’s movements.

With each line cleared, you score 100 points.  

To avoid misplacing Tetriminos and increasing your line height, “hold” a Tetrimino if you don’t have a good spot for the time being. 
However, you can only hold one Tetrimino at a time. 

Secret to Victory? 
    1.	Keep the prisoner alive within the 2-minute time limit. This means that no Tetriminos must fall directly on the prisoner. 
    2.	The Tetriminos must never reach the top of the Playfield.
